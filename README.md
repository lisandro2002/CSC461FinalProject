# CSC 461 Final Project


Utilizing the YOLO algorithm we will utilized multiple pictures somewhere in the range of 4 to 8 from the 20,000 images found within the imported dataset from Kaggle, to then predict the object found within the images that range from a bus, pedestrian/person, bicycle, traffic light, etc. Our main focus will be to accurately predict objects with their corresponding label.
