# CSC 461 Final Project


Utilizing the YOLO algorithm, a model that has a single-pass approach speeds up processing, suitable for real-time tasks. In addition, it excels in accurately detecting diverse objects within an image. Furthermore, we utilize multiple pictures somewhere in the range of 4 to 8 from the 20,000 images found within the imported dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contained multiple CSV that described the objects found within a specific by marking them within a rectangle. After creating the model we then predicted the object found within the images that range from a bus, pedestrian/person, bicycle, traffic light, etc. Our main focus will be to predict objects with their corresponding label accurately. Lastly, the result of confidence was fairly high of was it thought the object was, however, not a single object was predicted with a 100 percentage rather it ranges from the low 30s to the mid 90s.
